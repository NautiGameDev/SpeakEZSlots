## What is Speak EZ Slots?

Speak EZ Slots is a simple slot machine game made in Blazor Web Assembly after a brief trip to Las Vegas. I spent some time learning about the programming of slot machines and decided to come home and give a go at making my own. This project uses the Blazor Web App framework with the Blazor.Canvas.Extention nuget package for BECanvas implementation. This allowed me to use the Canvas element with C#, allowing me to almost bypass Javascript completely (Except for some window sizing and audio playing). The game is free to play on Itch.io, here:
